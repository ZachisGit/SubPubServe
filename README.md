# SubPubServe
Build a decentralized server infrastructure with a sub/pub queue based API instead of a REST based API server.
The main difference between a centrelized REST api and the sub/pub queue bassed api is that your server applications can be completele stateless while the client makes sure it gets the processed information it wants from the Peer-to-Peer network.


## Features

* IPFS based databases for long term redundant storage
* Automatic node discovery
* Automatic load balancing between all your nodes
